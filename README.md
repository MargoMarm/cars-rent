# Car Rental Platform
## Description


This project implements a car rental platform where users can browse and interact with car listings. The application displays eight listings initially, and more can be loaded by clicking the "Load more" button. Users can add listings to their favorites by clicking the heart icon, with the button changing color to indicate the favorited status.

## Features

- Load More: Additional listings can be loaded by clicking the "Load more" button.
- Favorites: Users can add or remove listings from their favorites. Favorited listings persist even after refreshing the page.
- Learn More: Detailed information about a car and its rental conditions can be viewed in a modal by clicking the "Learn more" button on a listing.
- Modal Interaction: The modal can be closed by clicking the close button, clicking the backdrop, or pressing the Esc key.

## UI Considerations

- Mileage Format: The mileage of cars is formatted with commas (e.g., 4,500).
 - Rental Car Button: The "Rental car" button functions as a link, allowing users to contact the company at +380730000000.
